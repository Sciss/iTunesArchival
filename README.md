# iTunes Archival

## statement

This is a utility that helps me copying audio CDs to hard-disc via iTunes 12, eventually converting the
full resolution AIFF files to mp3 with the appropriate tags. This is probably not useful for
anyone but myself, although it could come handy if you want to parse the iTunes library XML file.

## building

Builds with [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) against Scala 2.13.

Needs `lame` installed for mp3 transcoding.
